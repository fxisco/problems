/**
 * Challenge
 * Have the function StringPeriods(str) take the str parameter being passed and determine
 * if there is some substring K that can be repeated N > 1 times to produce the input string
 * exactly as it appears. Your program should return the longest substring K, and if there
 * is none it should return the string -1.
 *
 * For example: if str is "abcababcababcab" then your program should return abcab because that
 * is the longest substring that is repeated 3 times to create the final string. Another example:
 * if str is "abababababab" then your program should return ababab because it is the longest substring.
 * If the input string contains only a single character, your program should return the string -1.
